* Write your own NATO alphabet.
  There should be a function to
  encode and decode.
  The encode function will take a
  string replace all upper and lower
  case characters with their "NATO"
  equivalents and return the result.
  The decode function will take a
  string, replace the "NATO" characters
  with their normal letter form
  and return that.
  Non-alphabetical should be copied/stay
  the same in both cases.

Hint 1: You will need a hash table.

## BONUS!

Look at the wikipedia page for [ROT-13][rot13].
Try to write an encoder and decoder for
ROT-13.
