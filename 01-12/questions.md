Finish tic-tac-toe and do at least one of
ruby_koans or Improving a previous assignment.

## Finish Tic-Tac-Toe!

1. Finish your tic tac toes.



### Improve a previous assignment

1. Run `sudo gem install rubocop`
2. Pick a homework from last week and run rubocop on it: `rubocop hangman.rb` etc
3. Fix any warnings or errors found by rubocop.
4. Improve the design based on things you've learned since writing it.

### Ruby Koans

1. Run `sudo gem install rake`
2. Fork my repo: https://github.com/TIY-ATL-ROR-2015-Jan/ruby_koans
3. `git clone` your fork!
4. Go into the fork on the command line and run `rake gen`.
5. Pick three files (maybe arrays, iteration, and hashes) and run ruby about_xxx.rb
6. Complete the koans!

PROTIP: .gitignore has koans/* in it. You need to remove that line from gitignore to add your files!
