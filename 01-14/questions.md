* Copy the roguelike.rb game we made in class
  from the lectures repo and make it your own.
  Extend the classes in the game with new behavior
  and create at least one new class or subclass
  with unique behavior.

I will interact with the game via pry or irb
so it is not necessary to have a top-level
while or until loop to make me take turns.
Have fun!
