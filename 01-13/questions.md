* Update your Hangman game to use classes.
  * Copy the file into the 01-13 directory of your labs.
  * Create a `class Hangman` with an initializer for
    any needed variables.
  * You should be able to have two Hangman instances
    with different words and play them "at the same time"
    by calling a `guess` or `take_turn` method.

## Hint:
Not everything *has* to go in the hangman class.
It would be reasonable to keep at least a wordlist
outside of it.
